Design is related to the Greek notion which means an event in the making. To hold the profession and vocation of being a designer, one needs to be grounded in the awareness of the phenomenology of the drawing of lines, working between conceptual thoughts, experience-as-it-is and the creative imagination, and the chora-graphy of designed experiences. Design is more than just making things beautiful. It encompasses and orientates life. Design graduates from SP Design School should be able to initiate and develop them to seek an ethical function from being an unoriginal designer of hope, to try and reach a human commonality that begins from one's self. Our lives depend on the sharing of a bounded human condition where we are more interdependent than we realize. Our graduates could work towards a more compassionate aliveness starting with one's self-affecting others. The philosophy of Design School is - power of Design to transform lives by creating experiences." photos="sd.jpg">
